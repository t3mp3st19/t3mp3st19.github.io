It started after I became a web application security tester for my new position. I am relatively new to the field and I wanted to become a better tester. I decided that the best way for me to increase my skills was to take classes. 

The Learn curriculum is very compelling. It seemed like a perfect blend of languages (Ruby and JavaScript) because many of the sites I test use JavaScript I thought it would be useful to understand the language. I took the free bootcamp to test out the class material, and I liked the online environment. Since I work full-time, I needed something flexible. Learn has been a great experience! I already see my growth and knowledge increasing as I take classes. I highly recommend this program.
